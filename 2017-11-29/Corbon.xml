						<link class="reference_colindex" recordname="lists.spells.druid@Incarnate-5eExpansion">Druid Spells</link>
					</linklist>
					<p><b>Cantrips</b></p>
					<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>
					<p><b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b></p>
					<p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
					<p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spelllist. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minumum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
					<p>For example, if you are, a 3rd level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-Level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
					<p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
					<p><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></p>
					<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
					<p><b>Spell Save DC </b>= 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus</p>
					<p><b>Spell Attack Bonus </b>= your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus</p>
					<p><b>Ritual Casting</b></p>
					<p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
					<p><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></p>
					<p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>

Druids in this circle draw on positive energy to achieve their goals, granting them remarkable healing powers and the ability to restore the land.

					<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast. You can use this feature twice, and you regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
					<p>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a Challenge Rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a fly or swim speed.</p>

					<p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>
					<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
					<list>
						<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If both you and the creature have the same proficiency, use only the higher bonus.</li>
						<li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, however, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert to your normal form and take 9 damage.</li>
						<li>You can't cast spells, speak, or take any action that requires hands. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell you've already cast, such as call lightning.</li>
						<li>You retain the benefit of any feature from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
						<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equioment, based on the creature's shape or size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
