					<p>You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a theater, or even in a noble's court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.</p>

					<p>Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus, as described in Part 3: The Rules of Magic, Casting a Spell. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.</p>

		<notes type="string">Born into a dynsaty of bards, she trained as a dancer until B'yern (Bee-yern) the Bowmaster passed through her settlement. He made his bowstring sing and his arrows whistle. And he killed with one shot, stopping the hearts of his prey dead without a flutter. Theyadora was besotted and took up the bow.\n\nHer family disapproved, naturally, and Theyadora took to the road to pursue her calling, vowing never to return until she was an archer of reknown, worthy of a Bard's tale.\n\nShe believes her cousin, Erral (Bard), may be shadowing her at the behest of her mother.\n\nShe sustains a living as the Red Arrow (red cloak and mask and red feathered arrows), delighting crowds with her prowess with bow and arrow and throwing knives. But she knows she can only improve her skills in battle and seeks out danger with bands of adventurers.\n\nFavourite tricks: Firing straight up and having the arrow fall back to ground between her feet. And splitting an arrow with another.\n\nB'yern the Bowmaster is now dead, but she has heard that B'yorn, Son of B'yern, has followed in his father's footsteps, and she hopes to track him down and learn from him.\n\nShe may be a warrior but she bathes as often as possible (dislikes filth and grime) and adorns perfumes. Would like to learn how to make perfumes herself.</notes>

					<p>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is &#34;trance.&#34;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
